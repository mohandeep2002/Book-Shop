                  During the last decade, Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) have
                  undergone significant structural and operational changes, be
                  it two-phased amalgamation, implementation of CBS platform or
                  recapitalization, inter alia. Considering the growing
                  significance of RRBs in pursuit of financial inclusion agenda,
                  it has been decided to revise the priority sector guidelines
                  for RRBs. Accordingly, the comprehensive revised guidelines on
                  Priority Sector Lending â€“ Targets and Classification for
                  Regional Rural Banks are enclosed as Annex. The revised
                  guidelines supersede all earlier guidelines mentioned in the
                  Master Circular RPCD.CO.RRB.BC 5/03.05.33/2014-15 dated July
